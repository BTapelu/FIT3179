            <h2>Australian Car Fatality Distribution 2003-2023</h2>
            <div id="choroplethmap1" class="graph"></div>
            <p class="figure">figure 1</p>
            <p class="text">Check out our map — it's like a neon sign screaming a not-so-great fact: the <b id="nt">Northern Territory</b> consistently records 
                the <b>nation's highest car fatality rates per capita</b>. The roads here tell a story, and it's not a happy one. 
                This ain't just about numbers; it's about digging into what makes NT roads different. We're on a mission to 
                figure out the unique stuff making our roads riskier, aiming for quick insights into the why behind the tough 
                ride in the Top End.</p>

            <h3>Australian Car Fatalities by Age Group</h3>
            <div id="barchart1" class="graph"></div>
            <p class="figure">figure 2</p>
            <p class="text">
                Unlike the national rhythm, the 26-39 age group in the NT own a larger slice of the tragic pie, while those 65 and 
                older catch a break. Why the split? Theories abound — perhaps the vast, open roads tempt the younger crew. 
                Consider this: could tightening the rules for 26-39 drivers shift the narrative and make NT roads safer for all? 
                It's a road safety puzzle worth exploring in the Territory.

            <h3>Australian Car Fatalities by Day of Week</h3>
            <div id="linechart1" class="graph"></div>
            <p class="figure">figure 3</p>
            <p class="text">
                The line chart's like a heartbeat monitor, and the NT's got a rhythm of its own — it's leading the daily car death 
                count by a mile (or 1.6 kilometres). Friday and Saturday are the troublemakers nationwide. Why? Most Weekend 
                warriors on the drink might be the culprits. Time to consider stricter weekend rules or more eyes on the road. 
                Let's curb the Friday night fever and make the roads safer for all.

            <h2>A Closer Look...</h2>
            <h3>Northern Territory LGA Car Fatality Distribution 2015-2023</h3>
            <div id="choroplethmap2" class="graph"></div>
            <p class="figure">figure 4</p>
            <p class="text">Alright, fasten your seatbelts for a closer look at the Local Government Areas (LGAs) in the 
                Northern Territory. Litchfield has been facing a bit of tough luck, showing higher mortality rates compared to 
                its LGA counterparts. But when you zoom out, it's a bit of a rollercoaster ride across different neighborhoods 
                each year. Maybe it's time for a community-wide driving check-in - hit the road with a fresh set of eyes, so we're 
                all in sync on road safety. This is just a piece of the puzzle; let's dive into some other stats to get the 
                full picture.</p>
        </div>

        <div id="section3">
            <h3>Northern Territory Car Fatalities by Speed Limit</h3>
            <div id="histogram1" class="graph"></div>
            <p class="figure">figure 5</p>
            <p class="text">
                The graph tells it like it is: as speed limits go up in the NT, so do the car wrecks. No shocker, considering 
                the wide-open spaces. Surprisingly low casualties in the 90-100km/h range, but here's the deal - outside built-up 
                areas, the default is 110km/h, making those 90-100km/h roads rare. Now, take a look at >100km/h — boom, the 
                numbers spike. It's the outback reality check. Maybe it's time the government tap the brakes on those speed 
                limits for safer roads and fewer heartbreaks.

            <h3>Northern Territory Car Fatalities by Time of Day</h3>
            <div id="piechart1" class="graph"></div>
            <p class="figure">figure 6</p>
            <p class="text">
                The numbers don't lie—when the sun takes a break, danger hits the road in the NT. Nighttime accounts for a 
                hefty 55.7% of car fatalities, with daytime trailing at 44.3%. Why the dark divide? Theories swirl — maybe 
                stricter rules for nighttime drivers, like enforcing a passenger rule for young ones, could help. Shedding light 
                on secluded roads with more poles might guide the way. And let's not forget the silent killer — DUI. A campaign 
                for sober driving could be the beacon in the night for safer roads.
